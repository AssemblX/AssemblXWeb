AssemblX: A three step assembly process for up to 25 genes

To express large sets of proteins in yeast or other host organisms, we
have developed a cloning framework which allows the modular cloning of
up to 25 genes into one circular artificial yeast chromosome.
	
AssemblXWeb assists the user with all design and assembly 
steps and therefore greatly reduces the time required to complete complex 
assemblies.

	As compared to the AssemblX paper, the user manual provided here gives
	a more <q>hands on</q> version of the theoretical background and all
	the experimental steps that need to be performed during the assembly.
	AssemblX users with limited experience in the assembly methods that are
	part of AssemblX (SliCE, TAR or Gibson assembly) are encouraged to read
	the <a href="../../pdf/AssemblX_manual.pdf" target="_blank">manual</a>
