AssemblX: A three step assembly process for up to 25 genes

To express large sets of proteins in yeast or other host organisms, we
have developed a cloning framework which allows the modular cloning of
up to 25 genes into one circular artificial yeast chromosome.
	
AssemblXWeb assists the user with all design and assembly 
steps and therefore greatly reduces the time required to complete complex 
assemblies.

	<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li id="Testimonials">Before using the AssemblX cloning system I
			was trying to assemble two genes via classical cloning for two
			months, but it didn't result in an active expression of both enzymes.
			With the AssemblX cloning system I managed to assemble four genes
			under control of different constitutive promoters in 10 days and all
			of the enzymes are functionally expressed. (Daniel Geiger, University
			of Erlangen, Germany)</li>

		<li id="Testimonials">I used the AssemblX system to construct
			different multi-gene expression constructs for plants. Comparing with
			traditional restriction enzyme cloning methods, AssemblX offers a
			simple/less-demanding cloning strategy that allows high-throughput
			cloning of complex constructs. There is not a lot of commercial
			material needed for the AssemblX system. Beside that, I was impressed
			by the possibilities offered by AssemblX, since many different
			combinations of cloning vectors are available enabling
			high-throughput assembly of increasingly complex multigenic
			constructs. (Tjasa Lukan, National Institute of Biology, Ljubljana,
			Solvenia)</li>

		<li id="Testimonials">During a cooperation with the AssemblX team
			I was provided with three different yeast-expression constructs
			containing five, 10 and 12 genes. Cloning was very fast and first
			experiments confirm functionality. (Dr. Takayuki Tohge,
			Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, Potsdam, Germany)</li>

		<li id="Testimonials">I used AssemblX in a metabolic engineering
			project. With AssemblX I was able to easily assemble a pool covering
			81 different five-gene constructs. All constructs in the pool contain
			the same five CDS, but differ in the promoters/terminators from the
			AssemblX promoter library that control each CDS. Initial screening of
			the pool resulted in the desired metabolic modifications in my yeast
			strain. (Jorge Gonzalez de la Cruz, Max Planck Institute of
			Molecular Plant Physiology, Potsdam, Germany)</li>
