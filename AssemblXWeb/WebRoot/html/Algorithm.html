AssemblX: A three step assembly process for up to 25 genes

To express large sets of proteins in yeast or other host organisms, we
have developed a cloning framework which allows the modular cloning of
up to 25 genes into one circular artificial yeast chromosome.
	
AssemblXWeb assists the user with all design and assembly 
steps and therefore greatly reduces the time required to complete complex 
assemblies.

		The web tool provides an interface which allows the upload and
		arrangement of all sequences required for the complete assembly within
		the AssemblX framework. Level 0 assemblies are highly individual and
		require extensive primer design. This is automated by the web tool
		through forwarding the Level 0 sequence data to the j5 web server<sup>2</sup>.
		j5 is a DNA assembly design software, which basically returns all
		required primers for the AssemblX Level 0 assemblies. For more
		information on j5 and the algorithms behind it, please refer to the <a
			href="https://j5.jbei.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">j5
			homepage</a>. The AssemblX web tool processes the j5 output and compiles
		all sequences for the standardized Level 1 and Level 2 assembly steps.
		Finally, a complete benchtop protocol for cloning of the desired
		multi-gene construct is returned, together with reference sequences
		for all assembled products.
