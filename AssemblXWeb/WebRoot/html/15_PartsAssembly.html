AssemblX: A three step assembly process for up to 25 genes

To express large sets of proteins in yeast or other host organisms, we
have developed a cloning framework which allows the modular cloning of
up to 25 genes into one circular artificial yeast chromosome.
	
AssemblXWeb assists the user with all design and assembly 
steps and therefore greatly reduces the time required to complete complex 
assemblies.
